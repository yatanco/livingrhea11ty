## WHAT CLIENT'S SAY

_Rhea is like a walking breath of fresh air! She is poised, highly intelligent, and most of all she understands what it truly takes to lead a beautifully balanced life. I have had the privilege of working with Rhea in an intimate setting; she not only inspires me daily with her go-getter fire, but her natural ability to bring community and awareness to those seeking greater opportunities in their lives through holistic practices is phenomenal. Thank you Rhea for all that you bring to this planet; you truly are GOLD._

**[Angel Quintana](https://www.sacredanarchy.org/about), Founder of Holistic Fashionista and Podcast Host**

_Rhea offers a graceful combination of practical day-to-day logistical advice mixed with big-picture visioning. Working with her has triggered deep personal growth for me in terms of my diet, stress reduction, and even how I approach the world and my relationships. She is a patient and conscious listener and fantastic at answering the hard questions while helping you incorporate practices into your everyday life to stay. It is clear to me that what I’m learning with Rhea’s help will become cemented as habits and “ways of being” that will making a lasting impact on my well being. I’m extremely thankful to have stumbled into the opportunity to work with Rhea. It’s pretty rare to get to work with someone who has such in depth medical and scientific training (both in Eastern and Western philosophies), who also has so much to offer in the realm of mindfulness, intention-setting, and overall living more joyfully!_

_Rhea is a bounce of genius, a wealth of knowledge and a beacon of success. What ever the Mantra you profess, I truly believe she makes a real, wonderful and powerful impact. Alive food has a beautiful advocate, her name is Rhea._

**Myron Luis // Loving and living Rhea since 2011**

_Rhea’s passion is infectious. Her intrepid pursuit of her passion has inspired me to follow mine; and I’ll always be grateful to her for her limitless generosity._

**Rahul Sarugaser // Founder, Bespoke Craft Foods**

_There is something a little bit magical about Rhea Mehta. Maybe it’s all the superfoods she eats. She radiates good health and is a fountainhead of wisdom about all aspects of deep nutrition and even deeper living. Prepare to be supercharged._

**[Jeff Warren](https://jeffwarren.org/) // Writer and Meditation Instructor**

_Working with Rhea has expanded and pushed both my mind and body. Over the past months, she has taught me a tremendous amount about myself and how we, as a society, relate to food. Rhea has shown me how I can easily embrace whole foods, sports, and mindfulness into my academic life — predisposed to reading, writing, a whole lot of sitting. Ultimately, though, Rhea’s light and warmth transcends her expertise in the nutritional domain into all of her relationships. It is for this reason that I am forever grateful for both her friendship and support — thank you, thank you, thank you._

**Tahnee Prior // PhD Candidate & Researcher; Balsillie School of International Affairs**

_Thanks to Dr. Rhea’s counsel, every day I make sure to consume super foods and I’m also choosing food that is kind to my digestive system. I also undertook a juice cleanse with her that left me feeling vibrant and rejuvenated. I also learned that my intention transforms how my body receives and processes the nutrients from my food. Dr. Rhea is incredibly knowledgeable about the functioning of the human body. I feel empowered from the counsel she has given me and would highly recommend her to others seeking to transform their relationship with food._
