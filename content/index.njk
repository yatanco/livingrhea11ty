    <h3>Coaching</h3>
    <p>
      Personal development for a lifetime of healthy and rewarding habits.
    </p>
    <p>
     As human beings we are designed to self-heal. However, over the years we both knowingly and unknowingly introduce fat-soluble toxicants in the form of pollutants, heavy metals, pesticides, processed foods, and solvents to our bodies. When our load rises above our ability to cleanse the system naturally, toxicants get stored, instead of released. The consequences of environmental toxicity, paired with poor nutrition from our diet and from the soil that grows our food, is a recipe for several of the chronic symptoms we experience today, such as brain fog, headaches, low energy, poor digestion, constipation, and body pain. If we don’t correct this, the build up can eventually disrupt our internal environment, leading to disease. The good news is there’s a lot we can do right now.
