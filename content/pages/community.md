**I believe in a loving, non-judgemental community**

We all have one thing in common, and that’s health. Whether or not we’re on the same kind of journey, our outcome is always the same. We are moving toward feeling better.

But we’re all human, and our daily thoughts and actions are immersed in our own family, work and love affairs. It’s easy to lose momentum, come to a halt, or even turn the other way. Especially when we’re busy, stressed out, confused or sick.

That’s where the power of support and accountability from like-minded community comes into play.

I believe in this power, and I am committed to creating sustainable, healthy communities, both online and offline, who support each other through highs and lows.
