### [Consequences – My Creative Expression](https://www.livingrhea.com/health-poetry-consequences/)

CONSEQUENCES came to me at a time of deep inner reflection as I remembered my journey, and the journey of many members of my community. I’ve found myself feeling isolated at times, alone in my healthy choices and patterns. My healthy ways saved my life! And I’m blessed to be where I am today. But what I’ve realized overtime is that I can’t demand others adopt my strategies. I can inspire, while being me, and that is enough. CONSEQUENCES // I’m met with a choice To change my ways Are my habits serving me? Sometimes destructively Energy gone, emotions to grapple

The poem I’m sharing today, PREVENTION, is about my experience with taking ownership of my health and life, as opposed to feeling like a victim to its circumstances. I hope you enjoy. PREVENTION // I wish I could face disease I wish I could feel motivated to step up now Practice self-care I want to wake up I want to feel my aliveness in every moment I want to feel inspired to step up now I want to enter health now It’s okay if I don’t know how The clues will come My desire is enough My vision is tough

This creative burst has been an outlet for me to chant my soul’s song, using emotion and life experience. It’s been liberating to say the least, and I thank you for receiving my truth in this format. This next instalment, VITAL SIGNS, is connected to my father’s transition, and to my thoughts and experiences around the friends we keep closest to us, those who might not always have our healthiest interests at heart. VITAL SIGNS // Enter health She’s around you Surrounds you Within you Health gives us life But what is life Vitality or mediocrity? Do we seek help only

Today, I’m sharing I’M READY with you. It’s about my experience with emotional eating. I’M READY // Food is ready Belly heavy Am I hungry? I take a bite Out of spite I’m angry I feel low Thinking slow Eyes are closing A shot of espresso Make that two Now I’m running To the energy crash I feel like trash Side of fries, please Home alone Sweet tooth wins Everytime How could this be I committed to me I’m lonely Help me please Just hold me and love me One more chance One last dance I’m ready I’m so lucky

### [How I Discovered I am Enough (poem)](https://www.livingrhea.com/i-am-enough/)

A couple of months ago, I began feeling and hearing this flow of words and experiences come through me – starting with I am enough. These segments of my story, my journey, through dis-ease, loss, rebirth, and aliveness rang true and powerful. To me, at least. At first, I shared them sparingly, only with my husband and a few others close to me. But I’m sharing them with you, now, because I want to practice what I often encourage my clients to do: to lean into their fears and step into the unknown. This series reflects my life, my experiences

I’m excited to tell you about a groundbreaking stress reducing and sleep enhancing wearable device that actually works! It’s called Apollo Neuro, and it was created by Psychiatrist and Neuroscientist Dr. David Rabin, MD, PhD. It has been clinically validated to improve heart rate variability, a key metric of stress. Dr. Rabin noted that touch was overlooked in stress management, despite its ability to trigger safety to the body and lower stress. Through research, Dr. Rabin found that certain waves of vibration can bring our bodies and minds back to balance fast. And they can do this while improving our

The perks: After several decades and cycles of prohibition and acceptance, along with multiple uses of this functional product, hemp is here to stay! And we’re happy about that, because as a food, hemp is a nutritional powerhouse. It’s not just a complete and easily digestible protein, it’s also enriched with essential fatty acids, omegas 6 and 3, in their balanced and ideal ratio of 3:75:1. Hemp is also the only food source of omega 6 gamma-linolenic acid, which has been shown to play a role in improving skin and hair health, balancing hormones, and preventing inflammation. Finally, hemp is

For the foodies, the culinary curious, and those delving into the land of vegetarianism, the spiralizer is a kitchen gadget you must get your hands on! This gadget takes salads to a whole new level, by adding in a spiral twist. And the best part: the noodles, as satiating as they are, won’t leave you feeling full. Instead, they’ll fill you up with whole-food nutrition. Ideal veggies and fruits to play with include zucchini, daikon

The perks of a Blendtec Blender Blentech high-speed blenders whip fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and superfoods into smooth and decadent smoothies, desserts, soups, sauces, yogurts, milks and lattes. Unlike regular blenders, these blenders are designed to break open the cell walls of whole foods in such a way as to release the nutrients, without harm, and to produce high-quality results in both taste and texture. The high speed action enables the heating of foods and the crushing of ice, and the multi-speed option allows you to control the blending process to meet your food needs. These blenders are powerful, versatile, and

The perks of a dehydrator Make your own nutrient-enriched kale chips, dried fruits (think fruit-roll up!), breads (gluten days be gone!), crackers and desserts with one of my favorite kitchen tools, a food dehydrator! Dehydrators deliver foods, using low temperature heating, with essentially the same nutrition (enzymes, vitamins, minerals) as their fresh counterparts. These quiet and easy to clean tools remove approximately 75% of the moisture from foods, resulting in foods that are infused with a beautiful array of concentrated flavors. These differ from classic heating tools like the oven, which use heat at high temperatures to remove moisture, resulting

### [Coconut Sweetener Product Review](https://www.livingrhea.com/coconut-sweetener-product-review/)

The perks Coconut sweetener, in the form of sweet nectar or dried crystals, originates from the blossoms of the coconut palm tree. When the blossoms are sliced from their stems, or when the tree is tapped, a naturally sweet, nutrient-enriched sap is released. To prep the sap for consumption, quality products are low-heat evaporated into a thick caramelly syrup. This process ensures the product remains raw, nutrient-enriched, and alive. The syrup can be used as is, or can be dried and ground into crystals, better known as coconut sugar. Coconut sweetener has an incredibly low glycemic index score of 35,

### [14 Health-Sabotaging Myths Exposed By TOP Experts](https://www.livingrhea.com/14-health-sabotaging-myths-exposed-by-top-experts/)

  I’m going to be lovingly honest here… There are far too many “health experts” preaching so-called “health advice” that we are being led to believe is the Holy Grail of the “healthy lifestyle” dream we’re chasing. They are spoonfeeding you catchy claims like: “6-pack secrets they don’t want you to know!” “Fat-burning formula to lose 20 lbs. in 7 days!” And best of all… “The limitless magic pill they created from a powerful ingredient accidentally discovered by a group of scientists in the ancient city of Timbuktu that will change EVERYTHING!” And unfortunately — we’re eating it right up.

My willingness to being open to new perspectives and solutions has been a direct contributor to the flow, positivity and healing in my adult life. At age 15, I was told there was a very good chance I’d be in a wheelchair by my 40’s. I was told I had an auto-immune condition and there was nothing I could do but take medication. I bought into it for a while (8 years) and my body felt the pain immensely. I was debilitated and chronically stressed – from head to toe. Then one year, life \*magically\* shifted for me. And the

And let’s face it, the majority of us experience inflammation (stress) in one form or another on most days. This recipe is my twist on the popular ayurvedic Golden Milk. This one is low carb, which makes it acceptable for those who are drinking it for its medicinal value –> to reduce inflammation.   Ingredients 1.5 cups warm water or tea (chaga, chai) 1/4 cup coconut cream or unsweetened nut milk 1 tbsp coconut oil or MCT oil 2

Description My Green Warrior Smoothie Recipe is incredibly nutrient-dense and delicious! It’s nicely balanced with fiber, protein and healthy fat to ensure the natural sugars aren’t metabolized so quickly, thereby preventing a spike in blood sugar. This blender full of goodness is equivalent to eating a humongous salad, that one surely wouldn’t be able to consume in one sitting. But since it’s pre-chewed by our genius friend, the high-speed blender, we can easily take in the healing goodness in a form that’s accessible and absorbable by our digestive tract. Score!

I was there once upon a time, and it was an urgency that led me to change. I thankfully came out stronger and healthier, but it’s not fun to be the only one on this side. I won’t stop until we are collectively healthy. Changing our lifestyles is not easy. However, making micro-adjustments to certain aspects of our lifestyles might be a little easier to chew

The latter are referred to as medicinal mushrooms. These fungi deliver more healing than meets the eye. Superficially, they are loaded with vitamins and minerals, which is surely one of their superpowers. However, they also have bioactive components that they release to protect themselves during times of stress. These bioactive ingredients have incredibly therapeutic, and

The events of 2020 have shed a bright light on the challenges of the healthcare system, as well as the opportunities. We’ve seen the rise of digital transformation in healthcare, as practitioners try and adapt to the new reality of virtual care. Digital health solutions are in many cases replacing therapies, or accompanying medications as chronic disease management and diagnostic tools. To facilitate this shift, we need educators who are helping both patients and their doctors with the adoption of this digital transition that seems to be here to stay.
