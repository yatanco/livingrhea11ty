**Clean Sweep**

A 3-month comprehensive program to help you clean sweep your health and lifestyle. This program consists of one-hour coaching sessions every 2 weeks via skype or in person for a total of 6 sessions.

This program includes an assessment of your Health History and Metabolic Typing, followed by your Clean Sweep Action Plan, which includes:

- Education on mind-body optimization
- Identification of toxic triggers and removal/release
- Clean Sweep Shopping List
- Clean Sweep Meal Plan with customized recipes, supplements and self-care accessories, where appropriate
- Changemaker Tracker to pinpoint symptomatic patterns and monitor your daily progress
- Summary, notes and recommendations after each session
- Unlimited email support

Investment:

- $500/month; or
- Upfront payment of $1350

In this program, I will work with you to raise your health and lifestyle to a level that's aligned with your greater purpose. I’ll help you understand your specific nutritional needs, and I’ll guide you on how to deliver optimal value to your mind and body, while recognizing and overcoming habits that aren’t serving you. My signature program will enable you to move forward in life, feeling cleaner, lighter, happier, more motivated, energized, and purpose-driven.

As we go deeper into our sessions, we’ll go deeper into your life. We’ll talk work, relationships, creativity, purpose, physical health and happiness, and we’ll draw connections to your health and healing. At the end of our program, we will re-assess your goals and health status and decide whether to continue to work together on a bimonthly basis. We may also switch to a maintenance program, whereby we connect only once a month. This is decided on a client-by-client basis, depending on your needs.

I also offer multi-day Intensive Coaching, or what I refer to as an **In-House Coaching** **Program**. This method of coaching has proven successful for my clients who run businesses and/or lead very busy lives. To determine the most appropriate short-term and long-term health strategies and hacks for my clients, I shadow their daily home and work activities for a set number of days. If this is an area of interest, please contact me directly.

 

For all inquiries, please email info@livingrhea.com with the subject COACHING SERVICES. From there I'll invite you to book a free 15 minute consult to discuss.
