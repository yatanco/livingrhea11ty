**The perks**

Goji berries, also known as Wolfberries, are almost mainstream today, as they’ve been around a lot longer than other superfoods. They were introduced into the global health food scene in 2002 by David Wolfe and Sunfood, but have been known as a power food in China and surrounding areas for thousands of years. These berries, when sourced from reputable companies, are grown in protected valleys with ancient soil conditions. The handling process is quite interesting, as they can’t be touched by the hand while fresh. This would oxidize and spoil them. Instead, they have to be shaken off onto mats, and then dried. The source of these berries in particular is very important when considering the nutrient density, as conventional sources will often spray the berries with pesticides and synthetic fertilizers, and sometimes even label them as organic.

These berries are truly valued by the Chinese (and now the rest of us). That’s because they’re so good for you, and for so many reasons. Firstly, they’re a complete protein. They contain 18 different amino acids, making them on par with bee pollen. They’re also rich in antioxidants, and contain up to 21 trace minerals, with the main ones being zinc, iron, copper, calcium and selenium. One of the most important reasons, however, and one that distinguishes these super-berries from other foods, is their anti-aging power. Goji berries are the only food that’s known to stimulate the body to naturally create more human growth hormone. We produce less of this hormone as we age, so consumption of these berries proves as a good strategy to keep us youthful!

**Why I love this product**

Goji berries taste so good. They’re a cross between the cherry and cranberry, and thus the perfect satisfier for my sweet and sour tooth. They’re the ultimate snack food, for both at home and on-the-go, and taste wonderfully in a do-it-yourself trail mix, with raw cacao nibs, cashews and sprouted seeds. The bonus here is that they have an even stronger antioxidant effect when eaten with their counterpart cacao, so at the very least, my snack pack will always include the dynamic duo. I also love to throw them into raw desserts, for natural sweetness, and soak them in nut and seed milks or chia pudding, and scoop them up like I would cereal. They’re of course a terrific addition to smoothies, but I enjoy their texture so much, I’d rather eat them whole and savor the chewy experience. If you come across a dry batch of these berries, no need to worry, just rehydrate them by soaking them in water. You can also repurpose that ‘soaking water’ and use it as a smoothie base!
