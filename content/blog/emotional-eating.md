Today, I’m sharing I’M READY with you. It’s about my experience with emotional eating.

I’M READY //

Food is ready Belly heavy Am I hungry? I take a bite Out of spite I’m angry I feel low Thinking slow Eyes are closing A shot of espresso Make that two Now I’m running To the energy crash I feel like trash Side of fries, please Home alone Sweet tooth wins Everytime How could this be I committed to me I’m lonely Help me please Just hold me and love me One more chance One last dance I’m ready I’m so lucky It’s hard for me to see But I’m free To walk, to think, to act To be me I’m ready Take my hand Show me how I trust you now Baby steps okay Day by day The lowest hanging fruit Will deepen my root Slow and steady I’m so ready -------
