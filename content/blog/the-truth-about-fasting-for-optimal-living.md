**Today I’ll be sharing the second video in the series based on my talk at Envision Festival in Costa Rica - the truth about fasting.**

Before I continue, I want to say how grateful I am for having the opportunity to share my story and learnings in such an enlightening setting as Envision Festival and Costa Rica.

I’m acknowledging the bright community who invited me to speak, my friends who filled the room and held space for me to shine, my brilliant speaking coach, and finally, I’m acknowledging myself for believing in my potential and for putting in countless hours of energy and focus into preparing and visualizing.

**This second share is an important one, if we want to live long and vibrant lives.**

I started my health journey with a big fast or “detox” as some call it. It was the first time I’d ever taken such a prolonged break from chewing.

**Back when I did it, fasting was quite controversial in mainstream science.**

I did it anyway because I was desperate to look for a natural solution to my health crisis.

I was very curious and the cheerful guiding voice inside of me was getting louder.

**Here are some highlights from this weeks video:**

- Moving from a “fed” to a “fasting” state in the body triggers the removal of damaged cells
- Intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding (shortening your window of food consumption) can lead to weight loss, hormonal balance and longevity
- Withdrawal symptoms from prolonged fasting can be overcome or lessened through activities including the sauna, regular excretion, movement, yoga and sweating
- Watch the video here now.

**At the 0:45 mark** I make the distinction between fasting and fed states

**At the 1:56 mark** I share the reason why some of us feel sick during fasts

After you watch, I’d love to hear from you: Let me know in the comments below if you’re into the idea of fasting, intermittent fasting or if you have an experience to share!
