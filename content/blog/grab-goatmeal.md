**Tips and Techniques**

- If you’re missing one or more ingredients, don’t hesitate to use your creativity and create your own superfood mix

**Why I Love My Recipe**

On my busiest days, this recipe wins in ease, flavor (I never compromise on taste!) and nutrition. The benefit of soaking buckwheat overnight versus cooking it means you don’t lose nutrient density through the heating process. You instead retain all nutrients, and since you’re soaking the buckwheat in the dish itself, everything ends up in your sweet body. Another feature is that you can also prepare a few jars one evening and have breakfast and snacks ready for the next couple of days, which is not only ideal when you’re busy, but also when you’re on road trips. Think ready made super-meals stored in the cooler – genius!

**Benefits**

- Buckwheat and oat groats are a terrific source of gluten-free digestible protein
- Chia seeds and coconut are rich in health-promoting fat
- Goji berries and mulberries are excellent antioxidants
