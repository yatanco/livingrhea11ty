Hi Community,

I can't tell you how many times I've been asked to share what I eat, drink, apply on my body, read.... the list goes on.

People want to use what I'm using because they know how intentional I am when it comes to quality and experience. And y'all know I practice what I preach.

Well, I've got some exciting news to share with you.

I put together [my wellness shopping list](http://amzn.to/1XWywMd) (food, drink, beauty, self-care accessories) for you on Amazon.

It's pretty extensive and it brings me much joy to know how many of my fave products are now available on Amazon.. like top quality essential oils, beauty products and supplements.

I'm still adding new ingredients to my list... but I wanted to get it out for you asap because Christmas is right around the corner and so many of you have asked me for gift recommendations.

Self-care based gifts are the best! They're such a gentle way to share a little bit about your healthy routine with family and friends.

If you'd like to lovingly plant seeds for change, my favourite categories in [my shop](http://amzn.to/1XWywMd) are:

- Boudoir and Sacred Space (essential oils, acuball, non-toxic makeup and candles, etc)
- Powder Room (the cleanest in body and mouth care, body brush, bamboo toothbrushes, my favourite non-toxic deodorant)
- Cupboard and Counter (my preferred thermoses and kitchen tools)
- Pantry (my top recommended kitchen ingredients... perfect for gifting your foodie friends)

As always, feel free to comment below and let me know how you're feeling. If you'd like me to address a specific topic in a future blog post, please share your truth avec moi!

Much love and gratitude, Dr. Rhea
