I’m excited to tell you about a groundbreaking stress reducing and sleep enhancing wearable device that actually works!

It’s called Apollo Neuro, and it was created by Psychiatrist and Neuroscientist Dr. David Rabin, MD, PhD. It has been clinically validated to improve heart rate variability, a key metric of stress.

Dr. Rabin noted that touch was overlooked in stress management, despite its ability to trigger safety to the body and lower stress. Through research, Dr. Rabin found that certain waves of vibration can bring our bodies and minds back to balance fast. And they can do this while improving our heart rate variability.

The Apollo device was therefore designed by Rabin and team to mimic touch through these waves of vibration, thereby stimulating the trust and safety center of the brain.

The result: activation of the “rest and digest” parasympathetic nervous system, restoring balance in the body and mind.

It is unique in that it is considered a safe and non-addictive way to feel better over both the short and long term, by training your brain to bounce back more quickly from [stressful states](https://www.livingrhea.com/scientific-wellness/how-to-feel-great-every-day/).

# **How Apollo works**

- Wrap the Apollo device on your wrist or ankle
- Select the mode on the mobile app that best reflects your status
- Personalize the duration and intensity of the vibrations

### **Here are the 7 modes to choose from:**

- Energy and Wake Up
- Social and Open
- Clear and Focused
- Rebuild and Recover
- Meditation and Mindfulness
- Relax and Unwind
- Sleep and Renew

## **Benefits**

### **Increased Heart Rate Variability**

We all experience stress to varying degrees. Some of us experience quite debilitating symptoms as a result of the stress in our lives, such as headaches, anxiety, pain, frustration, lethargy, and the list goes on.

Stress converts external situations into internal reactions, and can have a long-term impact on [health](https://www.livingrhea.com/scientific-wellness/secrets-of-healthy-living/) and quality of life.

While there exist tools and practices to manage stress, such as meditation, breathwork and consuming an anti-inflammatory diet, as well as certain medications and nutritional supplements, Apollo works to optimize your stress response with little input.

Apollo is as simple as wearing a band to mitigate stress. It doesn’t get easier than that.

Specifically, it improves heart rate variability (HRV). If you’re new to HRV, essentially, the higher your HRV, the better you should feel. With improved HRV, you feel calm, relaxed, and better overall.

### **Better Sleep**

Stress also disrupts sleep. A stress-free system is generally associated with healthy sleep. With Apollo, there is a sleep mode you can select which actually helps you improve sleep in real-time through this gentle vibration technology. It doesn’t just improve sleep in real-time, but it also helps you sleep better over the long-term.

### **Improved Focus**

Focus is one of our greatest challenges today due to the many distractions, notifications and inputs---especially while so many of us are at home right now. And if we’re stressed or tired, it makes it even harder to concentrate.

Focused attention is necessary for high performance. Apollo gets us back into a focused flow.

The clear and focus setting on the Apollo app is one of my favorites. When it’s on and vibrating, I feel like in flow for hours.

I’ve gotten so much out of this device, that I signed up to become an affiliate. Now I can get you 10% off—which is helpful, since it’s a few hundred dollars.

To be honest, I believe it’s worth the investment considering how much money we spend on other therapies and treatments to help us reduce stress.

Those therapies might help in real-time, but they don’t continue to make us better and more resilient to the stress response.

There’s nothing else quite like Apollo.

If you get one, please share your feedback with me! I’d love to hear how it’s worked for you.
