This creative burst has been an outlet for me to chant my soul's song, using emotion and life experience. It's been liberating to say the least, and I thank you for receiving my truth in this format.

This next instalment, VITAL SIGNS, is connected to my father’s transition, and to my thoughts and experiences around the friends we keep closest to us, those who might not always have our healthiest interests at heart.

VITAL SIGNS //

Enter health She’s around you Surrounds you Within you Health gives us life But what is life Vitality or mediocrity? Do we seek help only when sick? How sick? What is sick? Does sick hurt? Maybe to your kids when they Find you, lose you, cremate you Were your cravings worth it? Did you know how to break it? What would you do with a second chance? Choose to be there for your daughter’s first dance? What do you do with a second chance? Stop smoking, quit drinking, let your guides in To teach you, to lead you, to feed you Accountability keeps us in check Reminders, notifications, post-its, friends Why do you have friends? To love you, to lift you, to hear you Why do we have friends? To fill the space, to validate our ways, to pass the days Nostalgia creeps in I see them, I offer commitment Because of that one time they saved me Or bailed and failed me? How do I let go and avoid sorrow Feelings help us grow Feelings help us show Up we go with clarity, prosperity A fresh perspective A breath detected From death to life From dark to light From blind to sight I choose vitality
