**In today’s video I get right into the foundation of gut health.**

Research over the last couple of decades tells us that gut health is crucial for overall health and that poor gut health may contribute to a number of diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis (what I was diagnosed with in my teens), diabetes, depression, autism, chronic fatigue syndrome and obesity.

Our gut health is determined by two main variables, our gut bacteria (microbiome) and our gut barrier.

In today’s video, I share the link between a weak gut barrier or lining and autoimmune disease.

I also share a few recipes I recommend for rebuilding the gut lining and reversing intolerances to common allergens.

**Here are some highlights from this video:**

- We underestimate the amount of fiber we need on a daily basis
    
- A diet low or lacking in fiber can be very dangerous for your overall health
    
- Glutamine is an important amino acid in restoring gut health
