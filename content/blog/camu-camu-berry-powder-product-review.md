**The perks:**

The power is in the name, well, mainly the first letters of this 2-worded Amazonian berry. Camu Camu contains more vitamin C than any other known whole food, fulltop. That’s a lot! For comparison, one berry contains up to 4% vitamin C, whereas a lemon may contain up to 0.5%. This super-berry gives meaning to the famous phrase ‘food is medicine.’ Camu Camu is what you want to have in your kitchen pantry, and eventually your body, when people start to cough and sneeze around you. It’s mega immune-boosting, due to its rich vitamin C content, and it’s also an excellent source of calcium, phosphorus, potassium and iron, as well as other powerful antioxidants like anthocyanins and bioflavonoids. ½-1 tsp/day is all you need for health maintenance.  

 

**Why I love camu camu:**

Besides the fun I get in saying its name over and over, this superfruit powder is an excellent tangy addition to smoothies and raw desserts. It’s my go-to superfood when I’m feeling under the weather, and just like its buddy the açai berry, it loves connecting with raw cacao. But this time, it’s the iron in the cacao that it helps pull out (vitamin C binds to iron, and helps with its absorption into our blood and cells). When I travel, it’s also one of my go-to-superfoods to take along, as it doubles as a water-soluble daily vitamin and anti-sick aid.
