**The perks**

Superfood Greens are a blend of the highest quality alkalizing greens powders. They’re made up of the alkalizing grasses wheat grass, barley grass and alfalfa and the detoxifying, mineral-enriched algae spirulina and chlorella. They also contain nutrient-dense and mega-tasty superfoods vanilla, mesquite and cinnamon. These powerhouse greens can be added to your smoothies or to a bottle of water for a super dose of energy and full body balance.

**Why I love my superfood greens**

It’s so easy when you have so many detoxifying greens in one blend! Since I’m all about ease and accessibility, this product is perfect for me. Just one scoop into my pre-blended smoothie or directly into a mason jar, blend or shake, and I’ve got my daily dose of chlorophyll and a boost of energy! Food Matters also goes above and beyond to discuss the sourcing of their ingredients, which is really important from a health and trust perspective. As a result, I take comfort in knowing that whatever amount I put in, is going straight into my bloodstream and cells.
