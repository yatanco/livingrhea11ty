## Description

Turmeric has become the talk of the town in the nutritional sciences community. Why? Because it's such a potent **anti-inflammatory**. And let's face it, the majority of us experience inflammation (stress) in one form or another on most days.  

This recipe is my twist on the popular Ayurvedic **Golden Milk**. It’s low-carb, which makes it acceptable for those drinking it for its medicinal value → to reduce inflammation.

- 1.5 cups warm water or tea (chaga, chai)  
- 1/4 cup coconut cream or unsweetened nut milk

- 2 tbsp turmeric (fresh or powdered)  
- 2 tbsp ginger (fresh or powdered)  
- 1/4 tsp cinnamon  
- 1/4 tsp vanilla  
- 1/4 tsp chai powders

## Tips and Techniques

- Ensure the water isn’t too hot — you should be able to hold a finger in it for ~5 seconds without pain.  
- If you can’t put warm water in your blender, blend with room temperature water and heat afterward on the stove.  
- Clean your blender right away to prevent turmeric stains.  
- Always add **black pepper** — it boosts turmeric absorption.

## Why I Love This Recipe

This recipe is a fun alternative to coffee or “foffee.” Instead of making you feel high, it makes you feel grounded and charged. It’s also a beautiful way to take in a higher dose of turmeric — let’s be honest, the spice doesn’t taste too great on its own.

## Benefits

- **Turmeric** → powerful anti-inflammatory and liver activator  
- **Ginger** → digestive aid and anti-inflammatory agent
