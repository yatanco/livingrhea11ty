**Description:**

Turmeric has become the talk of the town in the nutritional sciences community. Why? Because it's such a potent anti-inflammatory. And let's face it, the majority of us experience inflammation (stress) in one form or another on most days. This recipe is my twist on the popular ayurvedic Golden Milk. This one is low carb, which makes it acceptable for those who are drinking it for its medicinal value --> to reduce inflammation.

 

**Ingredients**

1.5 cups warm water or tea (chaga, chai)

1/4 cup coconut cream or unsweetened nut milk

1 tbsp coconut oil or MCT oil

2 tbsp turmeric (fresh or powdered)

2 tbsp ginger (fresh or powdered)

¼ tsp cinnamon, vanilla and chai powders

pinch black pepper, pink salt, stevia

 

**Instructions**

Step 1

To a high-speed blender, add warm water or tea, followed by the remaining wet and dry ingredients.

Step 2

Blend on high for 15-20 seconds and serve.

**Tips and Techniques**

- To ensure the water isn’t too hot, you should be able to place your finger underwater for up to 5 seconds without pain
- If you absolutely can’t put warm water in your blender, try blending the recipe with room temperature water and then heat it up on the stove
- Be sure to clean your blender right away to prevent stains from sticking around
- Black pepper helps with turmeric absorption, so be sure to use it in this recipe

**Why I Love My Recipe**

This recipe is a fun alternative to coffee or foffee. Rather than make you feel high, it makes you feel grounded and charged. It’s also just a beautiful way to take in a higher dose of turmeric, because let’s face it, the spice doesn’t taste too great on its own.

**Benefits**

- Coconut is high in health-promoting, energizing fat
- Turmeric is a liver activator and powerful anti-inflammatory
- Ginger acts both as a digestive aid and anti-inflammatory agent
- Chaga is a powerful antioxidant and energy-enhancer
