An attendee at the _Living Foods Work & Playshop_ I hosted early last year recently sent me this note:

_"Our lives changed forever after we attended your workshop! Whole food eating, no refined sugar or white stuff. I have lost 50 lbs since then (and still losing). Thank you!"_

**I share this with you because it's notes like this that fuel me and my mission of empowering people to upgrade their knowledge of personalized nutrition and shift their relationship with food and ultimately, self.**

During my playshop, I showed the group how to sprout seeds and beans, we made and drank balanced smoothies and we got our hands dirty with superfoods. The group quickly experienced how easy it was to create something delicious AND healthy in just a few minutes.

The majority of the superfoods we played with are actually shelf stable or will keep in the fridge for months: chia seeds, hemp seeds, almonds, goji berries, shredded coconut, coconut oil, raw cacao, maca powder, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, maple syrup, green stevia, etc.

A big takeaway was the desire to go home and clean up the kitchen and pantry and turn it into a health haven. So many of us slip because of the crap in our cupboards that call out to us in moments of weakness.

It's the new year, and I know improved/next-level health and nutrition is a goal for so many of you. Assuming you've already reflected on your health intentions and goals for this quarter and year, **my suggestion as a first step is to clean out your kitchen and pantry**.

Throw out the crap that's old and toxic and donate the products that you know aren't serving your body, but may support the health of others in need. Slowly begin to replace those items with brands and products you trust. You can use [my shopping list](http://astore.amazon.com/livrheyouguit-20?_encoding=UTF8&node=1) for ideas/guidance as I've hand picked the best products out there!

Keep things simple and clean. Print out a few recipes and keep them in the places you generally look when you're hungry and wandering your kitchen. This, of course, works best for those with a solid home base. The protocol changes slightly for nomads, but it can still be managed with a little prep work.

If you find yourself starving late night, unable to find a quick snack at home, here's my advice: Practice how to deal with it temporarily as an exercise to appreciate what it feels like not to get what you want exactly when you want it. Pay attention to what feelings come up. Write them down to help release them.

We are so lucky - let the gratitude fuel you. Call a friend, read or have a bath - you'll quickly realize how easy it is to find nourishment outside of food. And you may feel more inspired after dealing with first-world suffering to spend the extra few minutes at night and make yourself something clean, real and delicious.

A few days of this kind of practice in a clean kitchen will be so empowering. Please let me know how this goes for you.

Love, Dr. Rhea
