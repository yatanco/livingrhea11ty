**Description**

If you love mango lassis, you’ll love my healthy Mango Tango Faux Lassi. My vegan mango lassi recipe is a real sweet tooth satisfier. Because it’s nicely balanced with protein and good fat, it won’t leave you feeling heavy. Rather, the balance effect of this drink will keep the natural sugars from metabolized quickly, thereby preventing a spike in blood sugar.

**Ingredients**

2 cups water 1 mango, peeled 1/2 avocado 3 tbsp hemp seeds 2 tbsp chia seeds 1 tbsp coconut oil 1 tbsp ginger 1/4 tsp of cinnamon and cardamom pinch sea salt, nutmeg and cayenne pepper Optional: 1 tbsp natural sweetener (maple syrup, raw honey) and shredded coconut as garnish

Instructions

Add all ingredients to a blender and blend on high for 15-30 seconds.

Empty blender contents into a mason jar or cocktail glass (why not?!) and enjoy the mango deliciousness.

**Tips and Techniques**

- To turn this drink into a whole food meal, add a cup of greens, like spinach or romaine, 1/2 a cucumber and/or 1 tbsp greens powder, like spirulina. If your energy demands are high, add a scoop of raw protein powder or increase the amount of nuts and seeds (or their respective butters).
- Chew your smoothie! Digestion starts in your mouth, so the chewing action will activate those salivary enzymes.
- If you’re hooked on blended drinks, consider investing in a high-speed blender. It will take smooth to a whole new level, and will take care of protecting those healing nutrients, unlike other blenders which often slice the produce in such a way as to harm the cells. High-speed blenders include the nutribullet, vitamix and blendtec.
- To prevent this drink from oxidizing, store it in a tightly sealed mason jar, and fill it to the top of the jar to keep as much air out. It will store for 2-3 days, but it’s always best to drink within 24 hours for maximum nutrition and taste.

**Why I Love My Recipe**

I get a sweet tooth, especially when I’m with friends, enjoying a beautiful meal. My Mango Tango Faux Lassi is the perfect treat post-meal, as it’s sweet and satiating, but doesn’t leave you feeling lethargic and heavy. It’s also super easy to whip up, unlike so many desserts that require baking time. This leaves you with extra time for your company, family or hot date. Finally, it’s unique in colour and taste, which is a bonus when you’re wanting to impress friends and family with your culinary skills.

**Benefits**

- Hemp seeds and nut/seed butters are rich in essential fatty acids and protein
- Ginger supports digestion and reduces inflammation
- Mangos contain high levels of Vitamin A, fibre and Vitamin C, and contain compounds that help maintain the alkali reserve of the body
- Chia seeds, avocado and coconut are rich in health-promoting fat
