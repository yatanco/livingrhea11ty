## Description

If you love mango lassis, you’ll love my healthy **Mango Tango Faux Lassi**. This vegan mango lassi recipe is a real sweet tooth satisfier. Because it’s nicely balanced with protein and good fat, it won’t leave you feeling heavy. Instead, the balance effect of this drink helps prevent a blood sugar spike by slowing the metabolism of natural sugars.

## Tips and Techniques

- To turn this drink into a whole food meal, add a cup of greens (like spinach or romaine), 1/2 a cucumber, or 1 tbsp greens powder (like spirulina).  
- If your energy demands are high, add a scoop of raw protein powder or increase the amount of nuts and seeds (or their butters).  
- Chew your smoothie! Digestion starts in your mouth, so chewing activates salivary enzymes.  
- If you’re hooked on blended drinks, consider investing in a high-speed blender (NutriBullet, Vitamix, Blendtec).  
- To prevent oxidization, store in a tightly sealed mason jar filled to the top. Best consumed within 24 hours (up to 2–3 days).

## Why I Love This Recipe

I get a sweet tooth, especially when I’m with friends enjoying a beautiful meal. My Mango Tango Faux Lassi is the perfect treat post-meal: sweet and satiating, but light and energizing. It’s also super easy to whip up, unlike many desserts that require baking. That means more time for your company, family, or hot date. Plus, its unique color and taste always impress.
