**The perks**

Raw cacao is the cleanest, purest and healthiest kind of chocolate around. It’s the real deal, free of artificial flavors, additives, chemicals, dairy or gluten. What makes it so good for you is its high concentration of magnesium, which so many are deficient in. Magnesium is directly or indirectly responsible for many key functions in our bodies, including good sleep, stress reduction, brain function, bone and muscle development, healthy bowels, alkalinity, protein and DNA formation, blood sugar balance and energy production. Raw cacao is one of the best food sources of magnesium.

Cacao is also enriched with antioxidants, containing more than any other known food. It’s abundant in the mineral sulfur and contains over 300 other nutrients, including the ‘bliss chemical’, anandamide, the natural ‘love molecule’, phenylethylamine, the minerals zinc and chromium, and the stimulants theobromine and caffeine. Although caffeine content is low in cacao, theobromine is higher. But unlike caffeine which stimulates the nervous system, theobromine stimulates the heart, boosting heart function and blood flow. Finally, cacao also contains substances to ensure the absorption and long-lasting effect of the feel-good neurotransmitters it delivers to the body (serotonin, phenylethylamine, anandamide).

It’s fair to say that pure cacao is the ultimate powerhouse! However, many of cacao’s unique healing properties are killed through heat. That’s why it’s crucial to purchase cacao that’s been processed with care at low temperatures (considered raw under 40°C or 120°F), preferably from wild-harvest cacao pods in organic food-forests.

**Why I love this product**

Clearly raw cacao is awesome. I love using it in its powdered form in smoothies, namely dessert smoothies, and in raw, vegan treats. It’s bitter to the taste, often with mild hints of vanilla, so I’ll often blend it with fresh or dried fruit, like bananas or goji berries, or mix it with some raw honey or green stevia to satisfy my sweet tooth. As nibs, I love consuming them straight up as a snack! My favorite combination is raw cacao nibs and mulberries, which I often take with me on-the-go.
