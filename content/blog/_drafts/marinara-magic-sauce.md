**Description**

My Marinara Magic Sauce will spice up any dish! With balanced hints of savory and sweet, this sauce is the perfect addition to salads and raw or roasted vegetables. And it especially fits with my ZenZini Pasta Recipe. Bring it along to parties, or blend it up for date night. Whatever the occasion, this recipe wins in ease, taste and versatility.

1 cup sun dried tomatoes, pre-soaked for 10 minutes in warm water or overnight in fridge 1-2 cup tomatoes, chopped 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice or apple cider vinegar 2-3 dates, pitted and soaked for 10 minutes or longer or 1-2 tbsp natural sweetener, like maple syrup or coconut nectar 1 tbsp each fresh oregano and basil 1 tbsp olive or flax oil, unrefined and cold-pressed Unrefined salt and black pepper to taste 2 tbsp water or sun dried tomato marinade (add less water for a thicker sauce, and vice versa) Optional: 1 tbsp fresh oregano and/or basil, 1 clove garlic, 1 chili pepper, 2 tbsp chia seeds

Add all ingredients to a food processor (preferred) or blender and pulse on high until well combined, scraping sides as necessary. The final product should be tangy and subtly sweet. Adjust amounts of lemon and sweetener as necessary.

If sauce is too runny, stir in chia seeds and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes to allow sauce to thicken.

**Step 3**

Pour sauce over raw or cooked veggies, and garnish with herbs.

**Tips and Techniques**

- If your sauce is too runny, add chia seeds and let sit for 10 minutes. This will soak up some liquid (and add in a dose of super-nutrition!).

**Why I Love My Recipe**

Besides keeping well in the fridge for a good few days, I love the versatility of this sauce. It tastes great with nearly everything, from salads, to sautees, to dehydrated or cooked chips and breads. Adding chia seeds to this sauce is another bonus, not to mention healthy twist, as it ensures an extra dose of super-nutrition, without impacting the taste and flavor of the meal.

**Benefits**

- Essential fat and protein from chia seeds
- Powerful antioxidant vitamin C in sauce, which protects your cells from free radical damage
