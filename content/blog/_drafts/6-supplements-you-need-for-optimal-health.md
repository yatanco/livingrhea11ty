**I’m often asked if supplements for optimal health are truly necessary and why we can’t just get those nutrients from the food we eat (followed by a question about what supplements you need to take for optimal health).**

In a perfect world with the perfect soil, weather, and self-care practices, we might be able to get away with absorbing these key nutrients from our diet.

But, given our current lifestyle choices and environmental conditions, it’s just not possible to obtain every single key nutrient from our diet. And some of these nutrients, if missed, can have a negative impact on our health and happiness.

Omega 3 fats and magnesium are two examples.

**Here are some highlights from this week’s video:**

- Raw, uncooked real food can deliver ample nutrition to the body, in the form of enzymes, vitamins, phytonutrients, and fiber
- Vitamin D3 influences 5% of your genome and regulates your immune system
- Not all B vitamins in supplement form are created equally
- Vegetarians need to be even more mindful about nutrient supplementation
- If you’re drinking your food (I’m talking to you, smoothie lovers), make sure to chew it to activate digestion
