**The perks of Sacred Chocolate:**

Blissful chocolate without the guilt - that’s Sacred Chocolate for you! Sacred Chocolate is organic, raw, vegan and enriched with nutrient and superfood goodness. Unlike other chocolate bars which go through a heating process, these chocolates are stone ground under 115 degrees Fahrenheit or 46 degrees Celsius, from bean to product. They’re also low on the glycemic index, so they won’t cause a spike in blood sugar, but instead a slow entry with sustained energy overtime.

 

**Why I love sacred chocolate:**

You can taste the purity of this chocolate! And it doesn’t take away from the taste. In fact, it adds to it. I love how soft it is to the touch, versus hard and rigid like many other varieties. I don’t feel full after eating a piece, or the entire bar! … and trust me, I’ve done that. I also love the innovation of each recipe. The flavors are unique and very well balanced, indicating a superstar trustworthy team of product specialists. My favorites are India Sunset and Mylk.
