**The perks:**

After several decades and cycles of prohibition and acceptance, along with multiple uses of this functional product, hemp is here to stay! And we’re happy about that, because as a food, hemp is a nutritional powerhouse. It’s not just a complete and easily digestible protein, it’s also enriched with essential fatty acids, omegas 6 and 3, in their balanced and ideal ratio of 3:75:1. Hemp is also the only food source of omega 6 gamma-linolenic acid, which has been shown to play a role in improving skin and hair health, balancing hormones, and preventing inflammation. Finally, hemp is abundant in magnesium, fiber and iron.

 

**Why I love hemp seeds, hemp protein and hemp oil:** Besides loving hemp products for their digestible protein characteristic, hemp seeds are easy to work with. Most nuts and seeds require soaking before use for activation, but not hemp seeds! They’re therefore ideal for those on the go (easy snack), for making milk (2-minute blending!), and for preparing raw sauces and veggie dips. They’re also terrific as a salad and soup topper. The protein powder is ideal for use in smoothies, and blends very easily. I’ll often carry it along with me when I’m traveling and mix it with water as a daily health aid. Hemp oil smells and tastes great. I especially love using it when making salad dressings, and mixing with apple cider vinegar and a splash of balsamic or dijon mustard.
