**Description**

My Cashew Cream Twist recipe will make you forget about the days of dairy enriched sour cream. It’s decadent, it’s creamy, it’s smooth, and the best part, it’s as clean as can be. Kissed with sun dried tomato, my vegan cashew cream will make you melt.

**Ingredients**

½ cup cashews 1 tbsp lemon juice or apple cider vinegar ¼ cup sun dried tomatoes, pre-soaked for 10 minutes pinch green stevia, or 1 tsp unrefined sweetener of choice ⅛ cup water (start with less, adding more as desired)

Add water to your high-speed blender, followed by the remainder of ingredients. Blend on low, until mixture is smooth and creamy.

**Step 2**

Serve as a sauce with dehydrated or roasted veggies, or as garnish on soup.

**Tips and Techniques**

- Adding water to your blender first, followed by ingredients, will prevent the nuts from sticking to the bottom of the blender.
- Pre-soaking sun dried tomatoes in warm water enables them to blend more easily.

**Why I Love My Recipe**

Let’s face it, we all have creamy memories of our past. Most involved mayo, alfredo sauce, sour cream, philly cheese, and they often left us feeling full, bloated and gassy. My vegan cashew cream recipe enables you to re-live those moments, but with a happy ending. My sun dried tomato addition packs a tangy punch, in the most desirable way, leaving you feeling satiated and balanced.

**Benefits**

- Cashews are packed with health-promoting fat, nutrients and protein
- Cashews contain high amounts of copper, which plays an important role in the elimination of free radicals in the body
