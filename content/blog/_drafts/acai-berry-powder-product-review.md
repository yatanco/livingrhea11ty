**The perks**

Acai berry powder = antioxidant power! Açai berry grows in the Amazon and is considered to be one of the most nutritious foods on the planet, mostly because of its superior antioxidant activity. It’s more effective than both red grapes (10x) and blueberries (2x) at fighting off free radicals in the body. It’s also rich in iron, potassium, phosphorus, calcium, vitamins B, C and E, and is known to help the body in several other ways (immune function, digestion, anti-inflammation). It’s sold as a freeze dried fruit powder, which is key to ensuring its freshness and nutritional potency. One tsp/day is all that you need to keep those toxins at bay.

**Why I love this product**

The acai berry superfood has the most amazing flavor of fused blueberry-chocolate (yes it’s true)! As such, it’s not only perfect as an antioxidant-powered addition to smoothies, but it’s also a great way to naturally sweeten healthy desserts. Think raw macaroons and chocomole. Something else about antioxidants in general that I love, is the synergy they have when mixed with raw cacao (raw chocolate powder). The two love each other so much, that their antioxidant activity together is greater than their individual effects. Yes, synergy is a beautiful thing, especially when it comes pertains to our health! We don’t have to try any harder, and we get more inner bang for the buck. Great!
