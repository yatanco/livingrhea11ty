![Medicinal Mushrooms for health and wellness](/pages/images/medicinal-mushroom.jpg)

Fungi have been around on Earth for more than 2 billion years, pre-dating animal and plant life. While some species are poisonous, there are a number of species with superpowers that can nourish, heal, and boost the health of humans and our shared planet.

The latter are referred to as medicinal mushrooms. These fungi deliver more healing than meets the eye. Superficially, they are loaded with vitamins and minerals, which is surely one of their superpowers. However, they also have bioactive components that they release to protect themselves during times of stress.

These bioactive ingredients have incredibly therapeutic, and even magical healing properties, which historically led to their use as medicines in several ancient cultures around the world for the past several millennia.

#### Today, through the scientific method, we are now learning that medicinal mushrooms may be one of the most multi-modal healing medicines on the planet, with the potential to treat, heal, and prevent some of the most complex chronic conditions of our time.

# A Brief History of Medicinal Mushrooms

As mentioned, mushrooms have been consumed and celebrated by human beings in ancient traditions spanning the globe for thousands of years, as both food and medicine. Saharan aboriginal tribes in North Africa are said to have used mushrooms in 9000 BC. Mushroom consumption was also referenced in Tibetan and Siberian shamanism and Buddhism, as well as in spiritual texts from Mexico, Guatemala, and Mesoamerica.

Out of 150,000 known species, 14,000+ have been identified, with ~2,000 categorized as edible. More recently, medicinal mushrooms have been used in Traditional Chinese and Japanese Medicine for the management of conditions including cancer, diabetes, disorders of the heart, liver, and brain, digestive issues, longevity, and vitality. Some mushrooms have even been clinically validated in the East and approved as an adjunct therapy for certain cancers.

## Modern Science Has Its Eyes on Medicinal Mushrooms

Given the reverence of mushrooms in traditional therapies across the world, modern scientists are looking to validate and document the healing methods. The past three decades have seen growth in the scientific analysis of medicinal mushrooms, into a field now known as mycology.

This field investigates the nutritional (culinary) and therapeutic (medicinal) value of many compounds extracted from a range of mushroom species. Given the vast therapeutic potential of medicinal mushrooms, several other fields of science, including toxicology, immunology, and neuroscience, are also deeply investing in medicinal mushroom research.

Holistic health practitioners are also on the mushroom train, promoting the preventative and therapeutic health benefits of the most well-known medicinal mushrooms to their clients and communities. These include chaga, reishi, lionâ€™s mane, cordyceps, turkey tail, shiitake, and maitake.

While research is still in its infancy, positive results from cellular, animal, and some clinical data, plus the historical reference to frequent multi-functional use in ancient traditions across the world, have equipped several holistic health advocates with the confidence to both use and promote the safe use of these powerful mushrooms.

## Therapeutic Components of Medicinal Mushrooms

Medicinal mushrooms have three distinct parts:  
- **Mycelium** â€“ stores food and energy to produce a mushroom  
- **Fruiting body** â€“ the mushroom itself  
- **Spores** â€“ produced by the mushroom

Nutritionally, medicinal mushrooms are enriched with fiber, protein, unsaturated fatty acids, minerals, and vitamins.

There are also several bioactive compounds that make these mushrooms the medicinal superpowers they are. These include polysaccharides, terpenoids, phenolics, flavonoids, and carotenoids.

## Benefits of Medicinal Mushrooms

Research on the bioactive compounds of medicinal mushrooms has demonstrated several therapeutic activities, including:

- Anti-cancer and anti-tumor  
- Immune system-regulating  
- Anti-viral and anti-bacterial  
- Anti-inflammatory  
- Brain health-boosting  
- Anti-obesity  
- Anti-aging  

Wowâ€”right?

### Immune System Regulation

Probably the most critical therapeutic benefit of our time is the immune systemâ€“boosting effects of these mushrooms. Some species have been shown to increase the activity of the bodyâ€™s natural defense system, as well as the removal of damaged cells.

Given immune system dysfunction is a key factor in certain cancers, mushrooms could play a significant role in the generation of future anti-cancer drugs â€” with lower toxicity than current options.

### Potential Source of Vitamin D

Another critical benefit: vitamin D. Itâ€™s essential for immune health, bone health, blood pressure regulation, and nerve function, but not produced by the body. While we mostly get it from sun exposure or supplements, mushrooms may act as a great natural source of vitamin D.

Itâ€™s still unclear whether the vitamin D absorbed through mushrooms is in the form most bioavailable to humans. But given the limited sources, including a diversity of mushrooms in the diet is a smart idea.

Iâ€™ve been using medicinal mushrooms for over a decade for health and healing. I started with chaga in tincture and tea form and noticed improved energy and clarity. I then moved on to reishi, cordyceps, and lionâ€™s mane, which I continue to use today for:

- Immune system health  
- Brain health  
- Enhanced detoxification  
- Anti-inflammatory support  
- Longevity
