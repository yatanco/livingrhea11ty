Desserts shouldn’t make you feel guilty. They may be sweeter than the rest of your day’s meals, but hey — that’s why they call it dessert.

Whether you enjoy them as dessert, a weekend breakfast treat, or an afternoon snack, these little fudgey bites have you covered.

## Tips and Techniques

- Swap the sweetener for 1 ripe banana, or 1/2 banana + 1/2 avocado for a whole-food version.  
- For low-sugar, use **green stevia** or **xylitol**.  
- Substitute nuts with seeds (sunflower or pumpkin) for an allergy-friendly version.  
- Use **carob powder** instead of cacao for a stimulant-free option.

## Why I Love My Recipe

I love sweets, but I dislike the crash and cravings that follow most desserts. That’s why I focus on **macronutrient balance**: healthy fats, proteins, and carbs.  

These truffles satisfy my sweet tooth while giving me long-lasting energy. Their nutrient density also makes them naturally portion-controlled — you feel satisfied with just one or two.

## Benefits

- Nuts and seeds → rich in protein and healthy fats  
- Hemp seeds → perfect balance of essential fatty acids  
- Pre-soaking nuts/seeds → removes anti-nutrients and boosts digestibility  
- Raw cacao → antioxidant-rich “bliss chemical,” supports mood and provides magnesium + sulfur
