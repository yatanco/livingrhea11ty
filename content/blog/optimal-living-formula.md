My willingness to being open to new perspectives and solutions has been a direct contributor to the flow, positivity and healing in my adult life.

At age 15, I was told there was a very good chance I'd be in a wheelchair by my 40's. I was told I had an auto-immune condition and there was nothing I could do but take medication.

I bought into it for a while (8 years) and my body felt the pain immensely. I was debilitated and chronically stressed - from head to toe.

Then one year, life \*magically\* shifted for me. And the more I bought into the goodness, the more the goodness fueled me. I found myself in a positive spiral, and although over the years I've been kicked out of this spiral a few good times, I always find my way back - thanks to my willingness to seeing and doing things differently.

[In this authenticity podcast](http://makeyourmarktoday.com/Rhea-Mehta/), I share:

- How I'm feeling currently and why being surrounded by Mother Nature recently helped me feel more open and grounded
- Why my attendance at the Do Lectures inspired me
- Why it’s important to be vulnerable and create a space for people to be vulnerable
- Why it’s important to set intentions when you enter situations
- What my life and career goals are right now
- How I got to where I am today
- How I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis at age 13
- Why I started blogging and sharing
- How my PhD helped me become my own doctor
- What authenticity means to me

If you are moved in any way [by the podcast](http://makeyourmarktoday.com/Rhea-Mehta/), I'd love to hear from you in the comments below.

I'll leave you with this [recent authentic share](https://www.facebook.com/drrheamehta/photos/a.550336868345269.1073741829.397072023671755/935575839821368/?type=1&theater) and request of mine, that seemed to resonate with a lot of people!

Sending you love, Dr. Rhea xx
