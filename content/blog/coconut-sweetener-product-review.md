**The perks**

Coconut sweetener, in the form of sweet nectar or dried crystals, originates from the blossoms of the coconut palm tree. When the blossoms are sliced from their stems, or when the tree is tapped, a naturally sweet, nutrient-enriched sap is released. To prep the sap for consumption, quality products are low-heat evaporated into a thick caramelly syrup. This process ensures the product remains raw, nutrient-enriched, and alive. The syrup can be used as is, or can be dried and ground into crystals, better known as coconut sugar. Coconut sweetener has an incredibly low glycemic index score of 35, making it a safe choice for diabetics and those with blood sugar imbalances. It also contains over 15 amino acids, minerals, vitamins B and C, and has a near neutral pH. All great and unique attributes of a natural sweetener. Another key benefit over other sweeteners like agave nectar, is the low fructose content of 1.5% ( 0.5% glucose, 16% sucrose, and 82% inulin).

From a sustainability perspective, coconut palms (Cocos nucifera) are an ecologically beneficial tree crop that grow in diverse, wildlife-supportive agroecosystems. Other perks include the ability of these trees to restore damaged soils, to thrive off of little water and nutrients, and finally to be tapped without harming the environment or the tree itself.

**Why I love this product**

Besides the low glycemic index, which is probably the greatest benefit of all from a weight and health maintenance perspective, coconut nectar and sugar both taste great. They easily replace other sweeteners at the same ratio, so very little thought or additional planning is required, once you have the product on hand. I love to use coconut nectar in raw desserts or vegan pancakes, and to balance out savory sauces. Coconut sugar is my go-to sweetener of choice in blended chai lattes or spicy cacao drinks. Coconut sugar is also great for cooking, when you’re hoping to add a bit of sweetness to a sauteed dish or stew. It’s also my favorite flavor to add to stove-top organic popped corn, and create a caramelized popcorn-like experience. Brand and quality is key, to ensure the product you’re using is nutrient-dense (low heating process) and free of chemicals, pesticides or herbicides.
