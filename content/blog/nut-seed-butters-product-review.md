**The perks**

Offering all of the benefits of their respective nut or seed, these butters are incredibly nutritious and easy to digest, as they’ve already been broken down for you. Organic, sprouted and raw (unpasteurized or heated at low temperatures) are what you should be looking for in terms of quality. Sprouting nuts and seeds through soaking removes the shields they have in place to protect them from invaders. Only when these shields are destroyed can the nutrients from nuts and seeds be delivered to our bodies. If sprouted butters are out of your price range, you can also look for butters whose only ingredients are dry-roasted nuts or seeds. The dry-roasting process may kill some nutrients, but it will also destroy the shield, thereby providing access to the remaining nutrients. Besides looking for organic, sprouted, raw or dry-roasted varieties, you want to purchase butters that are free of additives and artificial flavors. Some butters will have inflammatory oils and refined sugars added to the mix. These are not approved as healthy varieties!

**Why I love this product**

They make for the best snacks, in flavor and balance, when consumed with fruits, like apples, berries or bananas. My favorites include butters of pumpkin seed, sunflower seed, tahini (sesame seed) and almond. I love to mix my butters with apple cider vinegar, stevia or raw honey, some spices like pink salt and cayenne pepper, and a bit of water to create a delicious nut or seed sauce that’s enriched with nutrients, protein and good fat. This sauce complements a simple green salad very well, whether raw or steamed. Because of the good fat and protein content, I also love to add my nut and seed butters to smoothies. Finally, these butters are excellent for local road trips, cottage stays, and they’re the perfect energy food to store in your drawer at work. A couple spoonfuls will keep you satiated until your next meal.
