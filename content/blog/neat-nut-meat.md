**Description**

My Neat Nut Meat recipe is a hit from head to toe! It’s nutty, cheezy and loaded with flavor! Eat it alone, with crackers, tortilla chips, or wrapped in a large green leaf. Whichever method you choose to ingest this belly treat, you’ll complete your mission with a big smile and a big mmm!

**Ingredients**

1 cup of walnuts, pre-soaked overnight 1 tbsp cumin powder 1 tbsp wheat-free tamari or coconut aminos ½ tbsp apple cider vinegar 1 tsp extra virgin olive oil 1 garlic clove, pre-chopped for 5 minutes ⅛ tsp hot pepper (add more as needed)

**Instructions**

**Step 1**

Rinse walnuts thoroughly and place in food processor, followed by all other ingredients, and process or pulse for 1 minute, or until the walnuts are finely chopped and mixture is combined, scraping down the sides often. Be mindful not to overprocess the walnuts, so their natural oils don’t seep out and turn your mixture into nut butter! Remove mixture and set aside.

**Step 2**

Serve with tortilla chips, crackers, or use it in my Rawkin’ Vegan Tacos recipe.

**Tips and Techniques**

- Almonds and sunflower seeds work well as walnut substitutes, both pre-soaked and well rinsed for 6-8 hours (or overnight)
- You can store unused soaked nuts in the fridge for up to 4 days, and if you’re looking for another use, throw them in the blender, add water, a touch of sweetener, and blend to milky perfection!
- Pre-chopping garlic and allowing them to sit for 5-10 minutes before use will enable the formation of healthy sulfur-containing compounds.

**Why I Love My Recipe**

This recipe is simple and nutritionally balanced. Because it can easily be made with other nuts and seeds, I never get sick of it. Instead I’m left feeling charged and satisfied. Being a crowd pleaser, it’s always my top choice for parties and hangouts, and the bonus is that it takes such little time to prepare (besides pre-soaking, of course).

**Benefits**

- Nuts and seeds are packed with health-promoting fat, nutrients and protein
- Garlic, when pre-chopped, gives rise to sulfur-containing compounds which are associated with prevention of heart disease, inflammatory disease, cancer and the generation of antioxidants
