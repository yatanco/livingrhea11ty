##### So many of us struggle with post-meal crashes during the day. We eat a meal thinking it will give us a boost or at the least satisfy our palate, and then 30 or so minutes after eating we’re overwhelmed with extreme fatigue.

Some of us fight the fatigue with an espresso shot, but as we know, it’s a bandaid effect and eventually, we’re going to have to identify the root cause.

If you’re tracking your energy levels and you’re pretty clear the fatigue hits almost immediately after your breakfast or lunch, you might want to consider tweaking your meals. Just a thought :)

There are a couple of ways to hack your productivity and meals so that energy levels go up or are sustained and in some cases, your operating system may even start to work better.

In the video I tell you about ketosis, or in other words, switching your body’s fuel burning system from carbs to fat by consuming high quantities of fat and low quantities of carbs consistently for a few days.

### While this form of eating benefits your brain and waistline, it’s definitely not for everyone.

So an alternative approach is to consume more (healthy) fats and fewer carbs for the first ⅔ of the day --- your ultimate productivity time, and then switching to a more balanced meal at dinner - with more protein and slow digesting (or fibrous) carbs.

Besides turning off your hunger hormones and turning on your satiety hormone, high fat (paired with low carb) is also slower digesting. That means there’s less of a risk of triggering an insulin response. The result: sustained energy vs a high, followed by a low.

Now if you’re someone who’s battling with high cholesterol or other cardiovascular issues, you might want to do some more research to determine if this diet is right for you, work with someone or do a small experiment to start to see how you feel.

Here are some highlights from this week’s video:

- Our productivity can be enhanced using food in a creative way
    
- Ketosis is a weight loss tool as it can eat away at our body’s own fat
    
- Over consuming protein can make you tired and gain weight

**At the 2:23 mark** I share an alternative “productivity hacking” meal structure that might not require as much willpower as the full blown ketogenic diet

### I’d love to hear from you: Have you tried a ketogenic diet or simply started to consume more healthy fats and fewer carbs? How did it make you feel? Let me know in the comments below.
