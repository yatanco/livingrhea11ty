**Description**

Have you heard? Foffee is the new coffee substitute and it’s freaking delicious! Adrenal fatigue is a real thing. So is coffee addiction. If you’re thinking to yourself, _I can’t give up my daily cup of java_, maybe it’s time you practice a little detachment and try something different. The plus side is you’ll be getting a lot more goodness in that 1 cup, free from dependency.

**Ingredients**

2 cups warm water or tea (chaga, chai) 1/4 cup coconut cream or unsweetened nut milk 1 tbsp coconut oil or MCT oil 1 tbsp raw cacao 1 heaping tsp maca powder ¼ tsp cinnamon, vanilla and chai powders pinch cayenne pepper, pink salt, stevia 1 small piece of fresh ginger 1 small piece of fresh turmeric

**Instructions**

**Step 1**

To a high-speed blender, add warm water or tea, followed by the remaining wet and dry ingredients.

**Step 2**

Blend on high for 15-20 seconds and serve.

**Tips and Techniques**

- To ensure the water isn’t too hot, you should be able to place your finger underwater for up to 5 seconds without pain
- If you enjoy this recipe, consider creating a pre-mixed jar for yourself, out of ease and for on the go energy
- If you absolutely can’t put warm water in your blender, try blending the recipe with room temperature water and then heat it up on the stove

**Why I Love My Recipe**

This coffee substitute is a performance enhancer! It’s got all the right ingredients to support happiness, satiation, energy and productivity. It’s my morning fix, right after my lemon water on most days. But the good news is that if I happen to miss a day or two, it’s not the end of the world. No dependency, only choice.
