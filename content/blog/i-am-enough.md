A couple of months ago, I began feeling and hearing this flow of words and experiences come through me — starting with *I am enough.*

These reflections emerged during my journey through dis-ease, loss, rebirth, and aliveness. At first, I shared them only with my husband and a few close friends. Today, I am sharing them more openly, because I want to practice what I often encourage my clients to do: **lean into fear, step into the unknown, and embrace vulnerability.**

This first poem captures my experience with self-acceptance (*self-love*) and the power of “mind coding” — planting seeds of positivity and hope in the mind.

## Poem: *I Am Enough*

> Sleep deprived, foggy mind  
> Half awake, I feel fake  
> I’m lying down, my brain still on  
> I want to cry, I want to die  
>
> I hear you share, but I'm not really there  
> I live in my head, in my bed  
> Wide awake  
> I want to see, I want to feel  
> Am I real?  
>
> Real is truth, truth is heart  
> But I'm so far from that part  
> Who grades me, who can save me?  
> I am enough, I can lift myself up  
> I carry that force, I am the source  
>
> If my words can hurt, could they love too?  
> You’re amazing, you  
> That felt good, though misunderstood  
> Intellectually, I can inspire change within me  
>
> Slowly, patiently, carefully  
> I feel better already  
> Hope helps us feel, hope helps us heal  
> A night of full rest could bring me to my best  
>
> Accepting what I am, where I’m at  
> And I’ll pretend I'm at bat  
> *Fake it til you make it*  
> I do subscribe to it  
>
> I’m rested, I’m clear, I’m full of sensation  
> Reflecting my new affirmation.
