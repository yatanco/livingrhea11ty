A couple of months ago, I began feeling and hearing this flow of words and experiences come through me - starting with I am enough.

These segments of my story, my journey, through dis-ease, loss, rebirth, and aliveness rang true and powerful. To me, at least.

At first, I shared them sparingly, only with my husband and a few others close to me.

But I’m sharing them with you, now, because I want to practice what I often encourage my clients to do: to lean into their fears and step into the unknown.

This series reflects my life, my experiences - and I offer them to you to explore, see what they bring up for you, and possibly, to relate.

I hope you enjoy!

The first poem is called I AM ENOUGH, and it captures my experience with self-acceptance (self-love) and the power of mind coding, that is, planting seeds of positivity and hope in my mind.

\-------- I AM ENOUGH //

Sleep deprived, foggy mind Half awake, I feel fake I’m lying down, my brain still on I want to cry, I want to die I hear you share, but I'm not really there I live in my head, in my bed Wide awake I want to see, I want to feel Am I real? Real is truth, truth is heart But I'm so far from that part Who grades me, who can save me? I am enough, I can lift myself up I carry that force, I am the source If my words can hurt, could they love too? You’re amazing, you That felt good, though misunderstood Intellectually, I can inspire change within me Slowly, patiently, carefully I feel better already Hope helps us feel, hope helps us heal A night of full rest could bring me to my best Accepting what I am, where I’m at and I’ll pretend I'm at bat Fake it til you make it I do subscribe to it I’m rested, I’m clear, I’m full of sensation Reflecting my new affirmation. --------

Thank you for receiving my words.
