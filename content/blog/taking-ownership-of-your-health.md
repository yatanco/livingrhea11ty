The poem I’m sharing today, PREVENTION, is about my experience with taking ownership of my health and life, as opposed to feeling like a victim to its circumstances.

I hope you enjoy.

PREVENTION //

I wish I could face disease I wish I could feel motivated to step up now Practice self-care I want to wake up I want to feel my aliveness in every moment I want to feel inspired to step up now I want to enter health now It’s okay if I don’t know how The clues will come My desire is enough My vision is tough to forget I keep it close, I keep it front I watch it, I feel it, I taste it I dream big, I feel strong Clues are here Clarity is approaching I hold her tight I remember my desire I recall my vision I pay attention I observe, I attempt I feel more alive This feels right I can see the light Keep going, love I believe in you Your world needs you Take your time, find your pace It’s not a race When motivation disappears Hold your dreams and vision near They will help you process your fears Breathe, you’re here
