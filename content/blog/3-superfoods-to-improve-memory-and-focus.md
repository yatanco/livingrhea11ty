##### Today marks the end of my sequence of video clips from Envision Festival, and I'm sharing some simple strategies to improve the functioning of our brain.

**It’s a common topic these days, as brain browsers continue to open and run in the background while we try to stay present and focused.**

Here are some highlights from this week’s video:

- Many of our ‘brain boosting’ superfoods today have been around for years in ayurvedic and traditional chinese medicine (bacopa, ghee, gingko biloba)
    
- Meditation is a powerful brain boosting tool that we all have access to (and it’s free!)
    
- Onboard health by selecting what you believe to be ‘easy wins’ or low hanging fruit self-care tools
