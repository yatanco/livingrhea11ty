Though a little embarrassing to share, I have fond memories of Campbell's creamy mushroom soup. The decadence, the savory taste, the ease of preparation — all amazing features.

But the heavy, rounded belly paired with low energy and sleepiness — not so much.

**So in my culinary lab we’ve uncooked up a healthier and equally as satisfying (if not more) alternative.**

Here's the raw mushroom soup recipe.

Makes 2-3 servings

_Ingredients:_

- 2 cups unsweetened coconut milk
- 1 cup hot water
- 2 cups cremini mushrooms (stems included)
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 tsp [ginger](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/tag/ginger)
- 2 tbsp wheat-free tamari or coconut aminos
- 1/2-1 tsp lemon juice (start with less and add more to taste)
- 1/2 tsp sea salt and black pepper (adjust to taste)
- 1/2 avocado (for extra decadence)

Optional: 1/8 cup porcini mushrooms, rehydrated in warm water for 10 minutes, 1/2 tsp red chilis, hot sauce or cayenne pepper, 1/2 shallot or pearl onion

_Directions:_

Add all ingredients to a blender and blend on high for 1-2 minutes.

If you're using a regular-speed blender, you may want to chop the spices (garlic, ginger) prior to adding to the blender, or use a hand blender to chop up any remaining pieces, especially if you prefer a smooth consistency. If your blender isn't hot water friendly, I suggest warming your soup on the stove on _low-heat_ until you reach a desired temperature.

If you're using a high-speed blender (Vitamix, Blendtec, Nutribullet), the longer you blend, the hotter your soup will become. Adding hot water to the blender simply reduces the blending time.

Serve immediately while it's warm. Top with [savory cashew cream](http://www.mindbodygreen.com/0-8796/forget-dairy-your-new-best-friend-is-cashew-cream.html), gluten-free crackers, black sesame seeds, or dulse flakes, if desired.

Take a moment to smell this healing soup before taking your first sip, and allow your memories of Campbell’s soup to dissolve into thin air. Enjoy a few deep, calming breaths to activate digestion and remember to "chew" your soup to stimulate the release of those precious enzymes in your mouth.

Happy soup sipping, slurping and chewing!
