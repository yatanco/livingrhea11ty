## Tips and Techniques

- Substitute walnuts with almonds or sunflower seeds (pre-soaked).  
- Store soaked nuts in the fridge up to 4 days; blend with water and sweetener for nut milk.  
- Always pre-chop garlic and let rest for optimal health compounds.  
- Add water first when blending nuts to prevent sticking.  
- For crisp taco shells, soak romaine/collard leaves in ice water 10–15 min before serving.
