**Description**

My raw vegan tacos are mouth-watering! They’re crunchy, satiating, delicious, and they’ll leave you feeling high, in the most natural of ways. Housed in a light and bright green leaf, my tacos can be eaten in two’s or three’s, giving you the chance to re-live the delicious experience over again. Trust me, you’ll be happy you reached for seconds!

**Cashew Cream Twist**

**Sassy Salsa**

1 cup tomatoes, chopped ¼ cup cilantro 1-2 cloves garlic, pre-chopped for 5 minutes 1 tbsp lemon or lime, freshly squeezed or 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar pinch green stevia, or 1 tsp unrefined sweetener of choice 1 tbsp chia seeds 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil ⅛ tsp hot pepper (add more as needed) sea salt and black pepper to taste

Add taco shells to an ice bath of cold water and ice cubes to keep the leaves submerged.

**Step 2**

For the Walnut Neat Meat, rinse walnuts thoroughly and place in food processor, followed by all other ingredients, and process or pulse for 1 minute, or until the walnuts are finely chopped and mixture is combined, scraping down the sides often. Be mindful not to overprocess the walnuts, so their natural oils don’t seep out and turn your mixture into nut butter! Remove mixture and set aside.

**Step 3**

Add all Sassy Salsa ingredients to your food processor and process for 15-30 seconds until well combined, scraping down the sides in between. Remove salsa and set aside.

**Step 4**

For Cashew Cream Twist, add water to your high-speed blender, followed by the remainder of ingredients. Blend on low, until mixture is smooth and creamy.

**Step 5**

Prepare veggie fillings and remove taco shells from ice bath, patting them down with a paper towel to dry.

**Step 6**

Add all fillings to taco shell, and top with sauces. Hold the base and tip of the shell for easy eating, but prepare to get your hands a bit dirty! Chew slowly and mindfully, knowing you are taking in so many different sauces and ingredients, and enjoy the experience!

**Tips and Techniques**

- Almonds and sunflower seeds work well as walnut substitutes, both pre-soaked and well rinsed for 6-8 hours (or overnight)
- You can store unused soaked nuts in the fridge for up to 4 days, and if you’re looking for another use, throw them in the blender, add water, a touch of sweetener, and blend to milky perfection!
- Pre-chopping garlic and allowing them to sit for 5-10 minutes before use will enable the formation of healthy sulfur-containing compounds.
- For my Cashew Cream Twist recipe, adding water to your blender first, followed by ingredients, will prevent the nuts from sticking to the bottom of the blender.
- Stirring chia seeds into the finished salsa will thicken in, as well as add macronutrients to the recipe.
- To ensure a crispy taco experience, submerge romaine and collard leaves in ice cold water for 10-15 minutes (or longer), then pat them dry with a paper towel
- Discard the bottom half of the collard stem before using.
- This recipe tastes amazing and is balanced with the walnut filling alone. Consider the additional recipes complementary, but not necessary.

**Why I Love My Recipe**

I love my recipe so much I could eat it for lunch or dinner daily for multiple days in a row (I’ve actually done this!). I love the real deal tacos, but they don’t love me. I often end my experience with a bloated belly and a cloudy mind. This recipe offers a similar if not better taste than the tacos I grew up eating, but also leaves me feeling wonderful. The 4-part recipe is relatively easy to put together, and the dishes keep well when refrigerated for a good few days. All the more reason to make extras!

**Benefits**

- Nuts and seeds are packed with health-promoting fat, nutrients and protein
- Vegetables deliver a diverse selection of both vitamins and minerals to the body
- Chia seeds are rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber, meaning they feed the microflora in your gut, as well as add bulk to your stool
- Garlic, when pre-chopped, gives rise to sulfur-containing compounds which are associated with prevention of heart disease, inflammatory disease, cancer and the generation of antioxidants
