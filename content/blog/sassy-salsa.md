## Description

This **Sassy Salsa recipe** is light, clean, and delicious — but with a twist: the addition of **health-promoting chia seeds** makes this salsa more than just a dip.  

Pair it with non-GMO tortilla chips, or serve it alongside my RAWkin’ Vegan Tacos for a nutrient-packed meal.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup tomatoes, chopped  
- 1/4 cup cilantro  
- 1–2 cloves garlic (pre-chopped and rested 5 minutes)  
- 1 tbsp lemon or lime juice (freshly squeezed) *or* 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar  
- Pinch of green stevia *or* 1 tsp unrefined sweetener of choice  
- 1 tbsp chia seeds  
- 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil  
- 1/8 tsp hot pepper (adjust to taste)  
- Sea salt and black pepper (to taste)

## Instructions

### Step 1  
Add all salsa ingredients to a food processor. Blend for 15–30 seconds until well combined, scraping down sides as needed.  

### Step 2  
Serve immediately with organic tortilla chips, or use as part of my **Rawkin’ Vegan Tacos** recipe.

## Tips and Techniques

- Pre-chopping garlic and letting it rest for 5–10 minutes helps activate **sulfur compounds** with strong health benefits.  
- Stirring in chia seeds not only thickens the salsa but also adds **fiber and omega-3s**.

## Why I Love My Recipe

Store-bought salsa often leaves me disappointed. This **homemade salsa** is so fresh and flavorful I can easily finish the bowl in one sitting — and it leaves me feeling nourished and satisfied.

## Benefits

- **Tomatoes** → rich in vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants (especially vitamin C)  
- **Chia seeds** → high in fiber, promote gut health, and add protein & healthy fats  
- **Garlic** → when pre-chopped, develops sulfur compounds linked to heart, immune, and anti-inflammatory benefits
