**Description**

My Sassy Salsa recipe is light, clean and delicious. With the special addition of health-promoting chia seeds, my healthy salsa becomes a complete meal. Enjoy it with non-GMO tortilla chips, or with my RAWkin’ vegan tacos.

**Ingredients**

1 cup tomatoes, chopped ¼ cup cilantro 1-2 cloves garlic, pre-chopped for 5 minutes 1 tbsp lemon or lime, freshly squeezed or 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar pinch green stevia, or 1 tsp unrefined sweetener of choice 1 tbsp chia seeds 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil ⅛ tsp hot pepper (add more as needed) sea salt and black pepper to taste

**Instructions**

**Step 1**

Add all Sassy Salsa ingredients to your food processor and process for 15-30 seconds until well combined, scraping down the sides in between. Remove salsa and set aside.

**Step 2**

Serve with organic tortilla chips, or enjoy as part of my Rawkin’ Vegan Tacos recipe!

**Tips and Techniques**

- Pre-chopping garlic and allowing them to sit for 5-10 minutes before use will enable the formation of healthy sulfur-containing compounds.
- Stirring chia seeds into the finished salsa will thicken in, as well as add macronutrients to the recipe.

**Why I Love My Recipe**

I love salsa, but I have always been disappointed with store bought varieties. My healthy salsa recipe is so tasty, I can finish it in one sitting! And the best part is that it leaves me feeling wonderful and satisfied.

**Benefits**

- Tomatoes deliver a diverse selection of both vitamins and minerals to the body, including the powerful antioxidant vitamin C
- Chia seeds are rich in both soluble and insoluble fiber, meaning they feed the microflora in your gut, as well as add bulk to your stool
- Garlic, when pre-chopped, gives rise to sulfur-containing compounds which are associated with prevention of heart disease, inflammatory disease, cancer and the generation of antioxidants
