**The perks of a Vitamix**

Vitamix high-speed blenders whip fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and superfoods into smooth and decadent smoothies, desserts, soups, sauces, yogurts, milks and lattes. Unlike regular blenders, these blenders are designed to break open the cell walls of whole foods in such a way as to release the nutrients, without harm, and to produce high-quality results in both taste and texture. The high speed action enables the heating of foods and the crushing of ice, and the multi-speed option allows you to control the blending process to meet your food needs. These blenders are powerful, versatile, and best of all, very easy to clean!

**Why I love my high-speed blender**

The texture it renders and its cleaning ease are top for me. It’s hard to appreciate the enjoyment of a high-speed blended smoothie ‘til you’ve had one. So, I suggest you find a friend with one, and test it out for yourself. Once you realize the super-value, the price point will be negligible. My favorite concoctions are my dessert smoothies (post-dinner blended bliss), and my nut and seed milks.

**Vitamix vs Blendtec**

I get this question often, and in all honesty, I love them both. They’re both equally functional, powerful, and accessible. It really boils down to aesthetics (size of base and jars, pre-configured settings, knob type and feel, color, etc), so I’ll leave it to you to make this call.

**Buying Guide**

When buying a blender, the key features you will need to consider are:

- size
- versatility
- pre-configured settings
- portability
