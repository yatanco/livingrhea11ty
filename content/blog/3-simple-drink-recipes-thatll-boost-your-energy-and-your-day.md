Ready to boost your energy?

This past February, I attended Envision Festival in Costa Rica as a participant and speaker. Actually, I also taught Caribbean dance, but I’ll save that share for another day ;).

My talk, entitled Simple Hacks to Optimize Your Health weaved my personal story of overcoming chronic disease into my mission of empowering people to unlock their healthiest potential.

I shared bite-sized daily hacks, simple recipes and the latest in nutritional sciences research.

I was lucky enough to have my talented friend Wilson (we call him PrimeTime) film my session, which I’ve decided to break down and share with you over the next few weeks as a series of 8 videos.

**We’re starting with one of my favorites!**

The content of this clip is near and dear to my heart, because I used these exact recipes to help bring my then inflamed body back to balance.

I’ve also prescribed these recipes to so many of my clients who have benefited immensely, from both an energetic and lifestyle integration perspective. The simplicity and accessibility of these recipes make them easy to initiate.

**Here are some highlights:**

- External stress translates to internal stress, which uses up nutrients and oxidizes things like protein and fat, rendering them useless or even harmful
- Drinking sea salty water first thing in the morning can make it easier for you to wake up
- Cycling between coffee and foffee can actually help you overcome deep fatigue
- The [real green smoothie recipe](https://www.livingrhea.com/recipes/green-warrior-smoothie/) is unlike most smoothie recipes in that it contains little sugar and mostly greens

**Watch the 3 simple drink recipes that’ll boost your energy and your day here now.**

**At the 2:00 mark** I reveal my energizing [foffee recipe](https://www.livingrhea.com/recipes/foffee-coffee-substitute/), a Living Rhea community fave! **At the 5:40 mark** I share the key ingredients to a daily shake that has truly rawked my world.

After you've watched, I’d love to hear from you.

Let me know in the comments below what you feel is keeping you from adding 1 or more of these recipes to your morning routine. OR if you’ve already started on these, how do they make you feel? And what about that foffee, huh?
