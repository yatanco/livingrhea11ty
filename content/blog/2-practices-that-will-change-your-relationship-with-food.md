**Did you know your relationship with food influences how you show up in your life?**

In today's video from Envision Festival, I'm sharing 2 straightforward and results-oriented practices I use daily to help me connect with my body and the food on my plate.

**The first one is a hack to connect you with your intuition, your heart, your gut instinct, the voice inside of you, your truth - however you want to frame it.** Have you ever thought something in your mind but felt an immediate pull in the opposite direction from somewhere inside of your body?

Perhaps you’ve said a yes to doing something intellectually, but heard this voice inside of you asking you to re-think it?

I’m sure you’re nodding a hell yes.

**The second is a practice that you can use before meals to essentially trick you into re-activating digestion.**

Because let’s face it, SO many of us are stressed out, and we learned in an earlier video that stress turns off digestion.

This practice will help deepen your connection with your food - and specifically, the journey of your food from farm to table.

Here are some highlights from this week’s video:

- We can actually hit the reset button on our body (hormones, metabolic processes and all) **in less than a month**
    
- Your rest and digest center of your brain (parasympathetic nervous system) can be activated through a few minutes of deep belly breathing
    
- Connecting with your food before meals is not only good for your health, but it’s also good for your relationships
