**The perks**

Coconut oil is an all round body healer. Good quality varieties are produced by grinding or pressing the coconut meat until coconut milk is produced. From there, coconut oil is extracted by an extraction process of centrifugation, which keeps nutrients in tact. Coconut oil stimulates energy and metabolism thanks to its fat composition, which unlike most fats, is primarily medium chain based. Medium chain fatty acids are immediately burned by the body for energy, unlike longer chain fats, which are stored. And thanks to its healthy fat content in general, coconut will take longer to digest, and therefore keep you full for longer. This is ideal for those wanting to control weight and balance sugar cravings. Coconut products are also one of the few foods containing immune-boosting lauric acid, a fatty acid naturally found in breast milk, which has antiviral, antifungal and antimicrobial properties. Coconut oil contains 50% lauric acid, and 1-2 tablespoons of oil per day is all it takes to support your immune system, and keep the bad guys at bay. As a bonus, your skin and hair will also benefit immensely by your daily coconut consumption, adding moisture and removing dryness. Finally, another fatty acid that makes coconut products so unique and powerful is the potent antifungal caprylic acid, which is famous for its candida killing effects. It’s also known to normalize your stomach acid, a complication experienced by many, despite not knowing it.

**Why I love this product**

The coconut oil I love is the real deal. It’s unrefined. It’s cold-pressed. It’s organic. And it’s free of pesticides and other toxins. It’s stable at high temperatures, therefore making it the perfect oil for high temperature cooking. Think stove top popped organic kernels (my favourite). Because of it’s amazing healing properties and ability to withstand heat, I love adding it to my morning warm lemon water and hot blended faux lattes. Like coconut butter, it’s also healthy by the spoonful, and will help curb cravings, as well as provide a boost of energy. Since it hardens at cooler temperatures, it’s the perfect addition to raw vegan treats that need a little bit of binding action for an ideal food experience, like brownies or macaroons. A little refrigeration is all it takes to hold the product together. As a beauty agent, coconut oil is my go to body moisturizer, hair conditioner, and makeup remover. Mixed with warm water, coconut oil removes makeup like a charm. Brand is important here, as not all processing is done the same. If you’d rather buy yours in stores, read the labels to ensure the it’s unrefined, cold-pressed, unheated, and handled with care.
